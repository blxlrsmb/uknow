\subsection{User Management}

\subsubsection{Register Page}

The register page contains an input form, users can only successfully
register an account if:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The username is unique in our database, and contains only letters and
  digits.
\item
  The password is no less than 6 characters, and does not contains
  digits only.
\item
  User repeat the password again correctly.
\item
  User provided a valid email address.
\end{itemize}

After a valid register form is submitted, the server side would again
check the input values. If the form passes, a validation email would
automaticlly be sent to the user with a confirm code. Otherwise, the
client will redirect the user to the original register page again, and
alert about this error message. This process is illustrated well in \figref{register}.

\subsubsection{Confirm Page}

A link to the confirm page should be attached in the email sent to the
user. An user account will be activated only if:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The email address was registered before but has not been activated
  yet.
\item
  User visits the confirm page within the time constraints.
\item
  A correct confirm code (dependent on this account only) is provided by
  the user.
\end{itemize}

Once an account is activated, user can then edit profile, change
password, and use all the other services provided by Uknow.

\subsubsection{Login/Logout Page}

A visitor will be redirected to login page everytime he/she tries to
visit a restricted resource. In the login page, the user is asked to
provide username together with password. A session is stored in cookie
after a successful login, otherwise, a ``password error'' message will
be displayed. On logging out, this session shall be destroyed and user will be
redirected to the  home page.
The login/logout process is illustrated in \figref{login} and \figref{logout}.
