\section{Interface}
  This part will be discussed with caution dreadfully. For that interfaces may changed a lot when developing.
  Part that we can be sure of is that JSON is used when communicating between client and API server.
  Then the API server will call various method provided by different classes that fit the requests.

  For that this project is still on the bootstrap step, and it may change everyday, we decided to mantain the interface information with
  wiki and API doc, other than write it done on paper.
  So, requests' format is still under discussion and it would change a lot. We don't think providing them now is a good idea.

  More, the prototype system does not containing a client program, so there's no need for stable interface design up to now.
