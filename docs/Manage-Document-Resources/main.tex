\section{Git}
\label{sec:git}
  Git is a very useful tool in teamwork development. All our members used it for a long time so we use it well.
  Merge, rebase and commits show our professional develop skill and the great work we had done.

\section{Issues}
\label{sec:issue}
  Issue Tracker is very common used in develop management. It can record the progress of a feature, a fix procedure of a bug, and so on.
  Every issue as a assignee that has responsibility for that issue with a deadline. Discussions can also be made and recorded under that.

  Up to now, we had created 30 issues, resolved 28 of them, most of which are features.
