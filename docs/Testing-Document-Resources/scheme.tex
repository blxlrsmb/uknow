\section{Test Scheme}
\label{sec:test_scheme}
\subsection{Test Level}
These tests call methods which simulate users' requests
and determine whether whole project can respond to each request correctly.
If the project gives the correct response as designed for one request, logic that get involved in generating response will be considered as tested.
Therefore, this test is at API level.

\subsection{Test Environment}
The unitest\footnote{\url{http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html}}
and coverage\footnote{\url{http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/}} module in Python and
Apache Bench \footnote{\url{http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html}}
tool are mainly used for testing, as shown as following:
