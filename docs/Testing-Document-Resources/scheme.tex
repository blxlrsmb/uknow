\section{Test Scheme}
\label{sec:test_scheme}
\subsection{Test Level}
This test use method which simulating users' requests
and determining whether whole project can response each request correctly.
If project gives the correct response as design for one request, logic that get involved in generating response will be considered as tested.

So, this test is on API level.

\subsection{Test Environment}
\subsubsection{Software Environment}
\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    \hline
    Name & Version & Purpose \\ \hline
    Python UnitTest & ~2.7 & Simulating Request for each API \\ \hline
    ApacheBench & >=2.3 & Performance Benchmark \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}
\subsubsection{Hardware Environment}
In order to run the test, a POSIX machine is required.
