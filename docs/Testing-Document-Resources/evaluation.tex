\section{Test Evaluation}
\label{sec:test_evaluation}
  \subsection{Evaluation on the project}
    \subsubsection{Functional}
      All APIs work correctly as expected.
      And all APIs is robust even under sedulous injection or other kind of inroads.
      This result reveals the wise design of this project at the beginning and rich knowledge of the develop team in network security field.

    \subsubsection{Performance}
      Both average performance and common performance are quite well,
      but there are still work to do to speed up in the worst case.
      However, the enhancement is limited, since in the worst case, the API will return too much of data,
      and the bottleneck is therefore at network bandwidth.
      Therefore, an API for incremental request is needed in the future.
      This kind of API will remember what they have provided and won't return them again if not directly requested.

      Regardless of this, the worst response time is admissible by user, so further enhancement can be arrested until it really makes sense.

  \subsection{Evaluation on the test}
    \subsubsection{Functional}
      Functional test includes legal and illegal cases, considered boundary situation and uncommon use cases.
      Besides, many common injection cases are used, to test the security of the APIs.
      This part of test cases are completed and have covered many professional assault method.
    \subsubsection{Performance}
      For more detailed result to locate the bottleneck of the system, an enhancement for the performance test is needed.
      Current result only shows the response time for all APIs but doesn't have enough details, such as time spent on network transform and database
      query.
